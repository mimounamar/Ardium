# Ardium


Welcome to the Ardium repository. Ardium was a Minecraft formerly used in a PvP-Faction server holding the same name (only v4 and v5). Please, kindly note that this repository was retrieved from anolder one as I couldn't find the original files and that assets were lost.

## Main Features

Built using Java and Forge, this mod includes the first lines of code that I have ever written. It essentially includes the following:
- A set of armors and weapons made with the new ores (Ardium and Oxium) included in the mod.
- Machines used to craft some specific items.
- Custom furnaces who are faster and cheaper to use.
- An agricultural system made in order to make farming ressources more enjoyable (inspired by Magical Crops)
- Custom CDs
- A protection to prevent people from cheating.

## Demo

Due to the loss of data encountred, I won't be able to provide you with the possibility to try for yourself. However, I can redirect you to the following video (not made by me) which highlights the most important features of the mod: https://youtu.be/NMIXehCsurg?t=184

## Warning

This project being my introduction to coding, it contains loads of bad habits and open 
source code remodeled to fit my needs. Please, kindly take into account this detail when reviewing this project.
